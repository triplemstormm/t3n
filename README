INTRO:
======
t3n is a high-level language designed for use in the upcoming 0x10c game. An EBNF is included to define the language. NOTE: This is NOT in its final form, so some features may be subject to change. 

=========
COMPILER:
=========
The t3n compiler is written in python. Its usage is as follows:

	python t3n.py < FILE.t3n

FILE.t3n represents your input source file. The t3n extension is not necessary, but recommended. 

=================
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
=================
The t3n compiler is written in python, and uses the PLY parsing tools. I DO NOT OWN, NOR AM I ASSOCIATED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS PROJECT.

SAMPLE PROGRAM:
===============

#calculate factorial
int fact(int f) {
        if (f == 1) {
                return 1;
        } else {
                return f*fact(f-1);
        }
}

int f5 = fact(5);
exit;
